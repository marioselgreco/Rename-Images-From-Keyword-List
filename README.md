This Python script renames image files in a specified folder using keywords extracted from a text file. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. Folder and File Paths: It defines the paths to the folder containing the images (folder_path) and the text file containing keywords (keywords_file).
2. Existence Check: It checks if the folder and keywords file exist. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
3. Reading Keywords: It reads the keywords from the text file, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace characters.
4. Listing Image Files: It creates a list of image files (image_files) in the specified folder.
5. Assigning Keywords: It iterates over each image file:
Randomly selects a keyword from the list of keywords.
Shuffles the words in the keyword to create a new filename.
Extracts the file extension from the original filename.
Generates a new filename using the shuffled keyword and original file extension.
If the new filename already exists, it appends a number to make it unique.
Renames the file with the new filename.
6. Error Handling: It handles any OSError that may occur during the renaming process.
7. Output: It prints a message for each file renamed and a final message indicating that all images have been renamed.

Overall, this script automates the process of renaming image files in a folder using keywords, potentially for SEO purposes or for organizing images based on relevant keywords.
PS. The second filw with OPENAI would fill the blanks if you dont have keyword list
